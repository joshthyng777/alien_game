# Alien Invasion
---

This project is heavily inspired from the book 'Python Crash Course' book by Eric Matthes. A very simple game made with Pygame (Unfished Version).
The images that I used are in the alien_game folder as well but, any image can work as the spaceship or alien.

Will hopefully add more functions to this project in the future but, it came out okay.
